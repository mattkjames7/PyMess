# PyMess
A Python module for reading the MESSENGER data (or at least some of it)

So far there are some tools for loading and plotting MAG, FIPS and NS data. The 
spacecraft position can also be retrieved/plotted. A list of bow shock (BS) and
magnetopause (MP) crossings based on the work of Winslow et al., 2013 is 
included, which are used to provide a list of times where MESSENGER is in the 
solar wind (SW) and the magnetosheath (MSH).

In future I hope to include EPS and XRS submodules too.
